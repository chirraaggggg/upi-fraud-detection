# Project Title: UPI Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the project on UPI fraud detection using machine learning! In this project, we aim to develop machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in UPI (Unified Payments Interface) data.

## Project Information

### Developer Names:
    Chirag Sharma

### Data Source:
The dataset used in this project is a synthetically created dataset containing 50,000 rows of UPI transaction data. It has been modified to include variability and patterns for fraud detection purposes.

## About the Dataset
The dataset contains transaction data related to UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions. It includes various features related to transactions and fraud indicators. It includes the data for fraudulent transactions for financial year 2023 to 2024.

### Features:
- Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- Date: Date of the transaction.
- Time: Time of the transaction.
- Merchant_ID: Unique identifier for the merchant involved in the transaction.
- Customer_ID: Unique identifier for the customer involved in the transaction.
- Device_ID: Unique identifier for the device used for the transaction.
- - Transaction_Type: Type of transaction (e.g., payment, transfer, etc.).
- Payment_Gateway: Payment gateway used for the transaction.
- Transaction_City: City where the transaction took place.
- Transaction_State: State where the transaction took place.
- IP_Address: IP address associated with the transaction.
- Transaction_Status: Status of the transaction (e.g., success, failure, etc.).
- Device_OS: Operating system of the device used for the transaction.
- Transaction_Frequency: Frequency of transactions for the customer.
- Merchant_Category: Category of the merchant involved in the transaction.
- Transaction_Channel: Channel used for the transaction (e.g., mobile app, website, etc.).
- Transaction_Amount_Deviation: Deviation of the transaction amount from the average transaction amount.
- Days_Since_Last_Transaction: Number of days since the last transaction.
- Amount: Transaction amount.
- Fraud: Indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the distribution of features and identifying patterns related to fraud.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
4. Model Development: Training machine learning models for fraud detection.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Conclusion: Summarizing findings and discussing potential areas for improvement.

Let's dive into the project and start exploring the data!
